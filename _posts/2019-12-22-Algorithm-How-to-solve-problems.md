> How to solve problems? the practice problem in programing => algorithm problem.<br>
  The steps to solve problems:
   1. Don't Panic!!
   2. Understanding the problem.
      - What're the Inputs?
      - What're the (expected) Outputs?
      - Work through some examples by hand.
   3. Simple mechinical solution and Test.
   4. Develop incrementally and Test.
